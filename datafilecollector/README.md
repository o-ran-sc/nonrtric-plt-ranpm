# DFC (DataFile Collector)

Datafile Collector is responsible for collecting PM counter files from traffical functions.
The files are stored in a persistent volume or in an S3 object store.

The origin is from ONAP. This variant uses Kafka and S3 object store and does not use the Dmaap.

Whole project (top level of DFC directory) and each module (sub module directory) can be compiled using
`mvn clean install` command.
